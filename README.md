# Traffic Flow Simulation using the Jacobi Method

## Overview
The **Traffic Flow Simulation using the Jacobi Method** is a Java-based application that models traffic flow across a network of junctions. It uses the **Jacobi Method**, a numerical technique, to solve systems of linear equations iteratively. This project provides an educational tool to explore traffic dynamics and analyze flow behavior under varying conditions.

## Features
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A graphical user interface built with Java Swing allows intuitive user interaction.
- **Iterative Simulation**: Simulates traffic flow iteratively, showing the evolution of conditions over multiple iterations.
- **Input Guidance**: Includes a guide tab to assist users in understanding input parameters and configurations.
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organizes outputs, input variables, and guides into structured tabs.
- **Convergence Check**: Verifies if the Jacobi method converges and notifies users about the status.

## Inputs
1. **Number of Junctions (n)**: Specifies the traffic network's complexity.
2. **Connectivity Matrix (A)**: Represents traffic flow relationships between junctions.
3. **External Forces (b)**: Indicates external traffic entering each junction.
4. **Initial Guess (x)**: Represents the initial conditions of traffic flow.

## Outputs
- **Traffic Flow Results**: Displays computed traffic flow at each junction.
- **Iteration Details**: Tabulated data showing changes in traffic flow for each iteration.
- **Convergence Status**: Informs users whether the simulation successfully converged.

## Limitations
1. **Model Simplicity**: Simplified traffic model; does not capture all real-world complexities.
2. **Numeric Stability**: The Jacobi method may fail to converge for certain configurations.
3. **Limited Visualization**: The focus is on textual rather than graphical output.
